## About Me

As a full stack developer, I am well-versed in both front-end and back-end development -- thus being about to cross the bridge between skill sets. Whether it's creating a modern, user-friendly UX/UI design, engineering server-side code to communicate with multiple databases, or architecting an elegant solution with multiple APIs, queues, and apps, I am able to provide outside-the-box thinking as well as a creative development process.
